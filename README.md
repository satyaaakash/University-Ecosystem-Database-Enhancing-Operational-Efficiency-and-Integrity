# University Ecosystem Database Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a robust database system for managing a comprehensive university education system. Utilizing Oracle 11g, the system encapsulates all facets of university operations, including student information, faculty details, course management, and extracurricular activities, among others.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Entity Integration**: Incorporates 8 major entities (College, Student, Hostel, Faculty, Library, Department, Courses, Extra-curricular activities) and various minor entities, providing a holistic view of university operations.
  
- **Data Integrity and Efficiency**: Achieves 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF normalization standards to eliminate redundancy and enhance data consistency. Implements constraints and functional dependencies to ensure data integrity across multiple relational schemas.
  
- **Automated Administrative Procedures**: Implements PL/SQL stored procedures and functions for critical operations, including scholarship allocation based on entrance exam rankings and club membership management, streamlining administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Database Management System**: Oracle 11g
- **Programming Languages**: SQL, PL/SQL

## Project Structure

1. **Database Design and Implementation**: Detailed documentation of the database schema, including tables, relationships, constraints, and normalization steps.
   
2. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Scripts and documentation for automated operations within the database, enhancing efficiency and accuracy of administrative processes.
   
3. **Triggers**: Implementation of database triggers for maintaining data integrity and automating system operations.

## Getting Started

To replicate or contribute to this project, ensure you have Oracle 11g installed and configured. Follow the documented schema to create the database structure and populate it with initial data for testing. Review the PL/SQL procedures and triggers for understanding automated operations within the system.
